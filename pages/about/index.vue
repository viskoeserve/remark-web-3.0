                  Unemployment can be seen as one of the severe socio-economic
                  problems that are being faced by both developing and the
                  developed countries. For example, in India, the rate of
                  unemployment has been increasing rapidly since the 2000s.
                  Today, billions of people are interacting over the internet in
                  several different ways and is exponentially easier to operate.
                  Overtime the problem in helping people get jobs or helping
                  corporates find people has changed from ‘simply finding the
                  people’ to ‘locating the right people’. This demand has risen
                  due to the sheer explosion of the number of people and job
                  opportunities floating on the Internet. This has led to job
                  portals slowly losing their relevance in the traditional
                  sense. However, following are some of the problems associated
                  with current digital recruitment portals:
                </p>
                <ul style="text-align: left">
                  <li

                  >
                    1. Rise in Technical Issues:
                    <span
                      style="

                      >During online interviews on the free video platforms like
                      Skype or Zoom video calls, it is possible to encounter
                      technical faults. It can be quite embarrassing for a
                      recruiter to be suddenly switched out of a conversation or
                      call due to an electrical outage, while having an unstable
                      internet connection can be awkward. This also means if the
                      company isn’t good at technology, they might encounter
                      such glitches more often;</span

                    2. Lack of AI integrated features:

                      through job portals is not enough to do an intelligent
                      match. Recruiters see very similar resumes of hundreds of
                      applicants making it impossible to figure out which

                      >A stereotypical recruitment process that does not promote
                      diversity or enhance inclusion makes the hiring monotonous

                      hiring due to unconscious bias, resulting in the loss of
                      great candidates. An unprejudiced recruitment process

                  procurement. In future, we are looking to launch training and
                  certification programs, where candidates would be trained for
                  interview preparation for various types of job postings. We

                  such as predictive analysis tool (where AI can be used to
                  predict the success of candidates in specific roles by
                  analyzing historical data and identifying patterns related to
                  job performance, which would help employers make more informed
                  decisions), automated skill assessment tools (where our
                  platform would be adept at assessing and verifying candidates'
                  skills through automated testing and simulations). We are also
                  strengthening our blockchain technology which would be
                  integrated into our portal to securely verify and validate
                  candidates' educational and professional credentials. This
                  could reduce the risk of fraudulent information in resumes and
                  enhance the overall credibility of the hiring process.
